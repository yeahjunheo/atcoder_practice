## 228. Summary Ranges

Difficulty: Easy
Time: 13:29

### 228. Examples

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"

### 228. Brainstorm

Looking at this, we know the nums is a sorted array with unique numbers.
The way I see how I could approach this would be to have a left `l` and right `r` pointer where I compare
the two to see if they are a consecutive range.
If `r` is `l + 1`, then we can move to the next num and incrememnt `r` by one.
If we see that `r` is not `l + 1`, then we can change `l` to the current pointer and write down the previous range?

## 268. Missing Number

Difficulty: Easy
Time: 2:50

### 268. Brainstorm

[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Since we set n as the total length of the array, and we're looking for the missing integer in this range from 0 to n
then we can check the difference between the gaussian sum of the range to the current sum of the whole range.
